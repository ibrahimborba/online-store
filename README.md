# Lint
The project was developed following the Clean Code standards specified by Airbnb's [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) and [StyleLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-airbnb) rules, since it's one of the most implemented lint packages.

Some minor configuration changes were made to better fit [Trybe's Lint](https://github.com/betrybe/eslint-config-trybe), because the project was initially developed following said rules.
